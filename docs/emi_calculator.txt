Rapipay EMI Calculation:

EMI Formula:
[P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]
Where:
- P = Principal loan amount
- R = Monthly interest rate (annual rate/12/100)
- N = Loan tenure in months

Example Calculation:
For ₹5,00,000 loan at 12% p.a. for 5 years (60 months):
- R = 12/12/100 = 0.01
- EMI = [500000 × 0.01 × (1+0.01)^60]/[(1+0.01)^60-1] = ₹11,122

Key Points:
- EMI remains fixed for entire tenure
- Interest calculated on reducing balance
- Prepayment reduces total interest outgo
